**1. Create a program that rolls a dice between 1 to 6.**
          **1.1 Your program should  display a message:**
```
          Winter is coming.
```
  >        If the dice rolled between, 1 to 5.

           **1.2 Your program should display a message:**
```
          Winter is here.
```
        >  If the dice rolled 6.

        >  Hint: Read about random number function here.
          Note: You MUST use if-else statement for this exercise and use the formula below to control the dice to output between minimum and maximum numbers.
```
          dice = rand() % (max_number + 1 - min_number) + min_number
```
        >  Hint: Read about C operators if you are confused with the formula above.

**2. Modify the program above using Ternary Operator**

          >Hint: Read about Ternary Operator, to find out how to replace if-else statement with these operators.  

**3. Modify the program above using switch statement**

          >Hint: Read about switch statement, to find out how to replace if-else statement with switch statement.
