## LAB 3

**1. Create a program that:**
          **1.1 Declare an integer variable called X and initialise the variable with 10**
          **1.2 Display the value of X on screen**

          >Note: Read about format specifiers to remind yourself how to display different data type.

**2. Create a program that:**
          **2.1 Declare two integer variables called X and Y**
          **2.2 Initialise X with 10 and initialise Y with 20**
          **2.3 Display the following six values: X, Y, X+Y, X-Y, X*Y, X/Y**

          >Hint: Expected output is 10, 20, 30, -10, 200, 0

**3. Create a program that is similar to the above, but this time make sure that the output for X/Y is shown as 0.50**

          >Note: Read about Conversion Specifiers and Precisions to remind yourself how to display different output values with different number of decimal points



**4. Use #define directive (macro definition) to define a variable called x with an initial value of 100. Display the value of x and x * 10 using printf statements**



**5. Use the const keyboard to define a constant in C. Name it x and initialize to 150. Display its value using a printf statement. What happens if you try to change its value from 150 to 200?**



**6. Write a programme that declares a variable x of type integer and assignes to it the value of letter A. Use a printf to print the value of x. Try to explain what is happening here?**
