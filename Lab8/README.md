## LAB 8

**1. Create a program that declare an array of size 10**
     **1.1 Request 10 integer input from the user and each time insert their input into a cell in the array starting from cell zero**
     **1.2 Use loop to find the largest number in the array**
     **1.3 Display the largest number to the user**

**2. Read about ASCII table, you will see that 'A' is equal to 65 in integer (see Dec column), 'B' is equal to 66 and so on**
     **2.1 Create a program that declare an array of size 10**
     **2.2 Request 10 character input from the user and each time insert their input into a cell in the array starting from cell zero**
     **2.3 Use loop to find the largest character in the array based on their integer value**
     **2.4 Display the largest character to the user**

**3. Create a program that declare an array of size 10**
     **3.1 Using for loop to initialise the array, for cell zero insert 10, for cell one insert 20, for cell two insert 30, ... until the last cell insert 100**
     **3.2 Display the content of the array**


**4. Declare an array of character called mystring with a size of 100**
          **4.1 Display appropriate message to request for user input**
          **4.2 Request an input from the user and store it in mystring**
          **4.3 Display the content of mystring, the length of the user input i.e. number of characters, and the size of mystring**

**5. Declare two arrays of character called arr1 and arr2, each of which has a size of 100**
          **5.1. Initialise arr1 with hello world, and initialise arr2 with your own name**
          **5.2 Swap the content of the two arrays**
          **5.3 Display the content of the two arrays**

**6. Create a program that force the user to enter a string that has between 5 to 10 characters by using infinite loop**
          **6.1 Display the input from the user when the user enter the correct length string**

          >Hint: check out getchar function, if you need a bit of help
