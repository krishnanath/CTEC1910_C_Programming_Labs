## LAB 2

**1. Create a program that will print out:**
```
          She sells sea shells
```

**2. Create a program that will print out:**
```
          She sells
          sea shells
```
    >      Note: this program must display the message in two lines using two printf statements

**3. Create a program that will print out:**
```
          She sells
          sea shells
```
    >      Note: this program must display the message in two lines BUT using only one printf statement


**4.  Create a text file called box.c that contains the following C program:**
```
#include <stdio.h>



int main()

{

    printf ("\t***\n");

    printf ("\t***\n");

    printf ("\t***\n");

    return 0;

}
```

**5. Write, compile and run a C program, diamond.c, which outputs a small diamond shape (made of *s) on the terminal.**



**6. Create a text file called tabs1.c that contains the following C program:**
```
#include <stdio.h>



int main()

{

    printf ("\t1\t2\t3\n");

    printf ("\t4\t5\t6\n");

    printf ("\t7\t8\t9\n");

    return 0;

}
```

**7. Create a text file called tabs2.c that contains the following C program:**
```
#include <stdio.h>



int main()

{

    printf ("\t1\t2\t3\n\t4\t5\t6\n\t7\t8\t9\n");

    return 0;

}
```


**8. Write, compile and run a C program, poem1.c, that outputs the following poem on the terminal.**
```
Ensanguining the sky
How heavily it dies
Into the west away
Past touch and sight and sound
No longer to be found
How hopeless underground
Falls the remorseless day
```

**But, you are only allowed to use ONE printf statement.**

**9. Write, compile and run a C program, bigX.c, that outputs the following big X on the terminal.**
```

\\  //


 \\//


 //\\


//  \\

```


**(This time you can use as many printf statements as you like.)**

**10. Write, compile and run a C program, dice.c, that outputs the faces of two dice (showing three and five) on the terminal. NB The "pips" on each face are made from percent signs (first die) and double quote symbols (second die).**
```

    %    "   "


  %        "


%        "   "

```
