## LAB 10

**1. Read about pointer initialisation and dereferencing**
          **1.1 Declare an integer variable called a and an integer pointer called ptr**
          **1.2 Assign a value of 10 to the integer variable a**
          **1.3 Initialise the integer pointer ptr with the memory address of a**
          **1.4 Modify the value of the integer variable a to 15 by dereferencing the integer pointer ptr**
          **1.5 Display the value of a, memory address of a and the memory address of ptr**

**2. Declare two integer variables called a and b, and an integer pointer called ptr**
          **2.1 Assign a value of 20 to b**
          **2.2 Initialise the integer pointer ptr with the memory address of b**
          **2.3 Initialise the variable a by dereferencing the integer pointer ptr**
          **2.4 Modify the value of the integer variable b to 30 by dereferencing the integer pointer ptr**
          **2.5 Display the value of a, the value of b, memory address of a, memory address of b, and the memory address of ptr**

**3. Declare an integer variable called a, one integer pointer called ptr1 and one integer pointer to pointer called ptr2**
          **3.1 Assign a value of 30 to a**
          **3.2 Initialise the integer pointer ptr1 with the memory address of a**
          **3.3 Initialise the integer pointer ptr2 with the memory address of a by dereferencing the integer pointer ptr1**
          **3.4 Modify the value of variable a to 35 by dereferencing the integer pointer ptr2**
          **3.5 Display the value of a, memory address of a, memory address of ptr1, and the memory address of ptr2**
